## Shared Technology Information

This is a place I can share tidbits of technology. I hope to create several fun workshops to help people get started building their own technology solutions, especially those that incorporate software and hardware. The benefits of open source collaboration are immense, which is why I've always been a fan of FLOSS, open hardware, and even open 'silicon' approaches. We all stand on the shoulders of other brilliant men and women. In this site I advertise my current favorite collaborative technology projects. I also create content to help you try them, tweak them, and make them better for yourself.

### Mozilla Project Things

https://iot.mozilla.org - 
Fun project, terrific people, excellent potential (and already useful running in my own home). Join this fully open and community supported project to bring IoT devices to the web, in a private, secure, and interoperable manner.

### MicroBlocks

http://microblocks.fun - 
Phenomenal blocks-based programming tool for building your own Mozilla "web things" out of any of the supported 32-bit MCU boards. Unlike Snap4Arduino, these MicroBlocks programs run even after you disconnect the board from your computer. Easily build your own IoT devices as standard web of things devices!

### Snap! and Snap4Arduino

https://snap.berkeley.edu/ - 
http://snap4arduino.rocks/ - 
Snap! is like MicroBlocks but focused on the computing platform you are doing the developing on. It was built because of limitations in Scratch so it lets you go as far as your imagination in first class programming constructs. 
Snap4Arduino lets you bridge the development platform and the real world of microcontroller boards that can run Arduino and Standard Firmata. Like MicroBlocks, it is a superb way to engage in programmable interaction with the physical world.

### PlatformIO

https://platformio.org - 
When I'm not programming in blocks, I prefer to use PlatformIO to program any MCU hardware that supports the Arduino framework.

### Oryng

http://oryng.org - 
Focus on curating the heart of the Arduino/Wiring Framework, independent of what hw, sw, or development tools you like to use.

### Arduino

http://arduino.cc - 
Such a wealth of community collaboration and libraries that make it easier to build things.

### Docs

Not exactly sure yet how I will organize this site yet, but one benefit will be the ability to share documents. Useful for sharing information that I generate and use when giving workshops, conferences, and supporting them with online tutorials.
